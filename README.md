OnStep Telescope Controller
===========================
# Important Note

THIS IS THE STABLE BRANCH, IF YOU'RE USING THIS AND ARE HAPPY CARRY ON! THE BETA BRANCH IS RECOMMENDED FOR MOST USERS THOUGH. NO NEW FEATURES AND BUG FIXES ONLY WHEN I DEEM THEM NECESSARY AND VERY LOW RISK. MAJOR UPDATES TO THIS BRANCH CAN TAKE A YEAR OR MORE.

THE BETA BRANCH IS RECOMMENDED FOR MOST USERS.

# What is OnStep?
OnStep is a computerized telescope goto controller, based on Teensy or
Arduino control of stepper motors.

It supports Equatorial Mounts (GEM, Fork, etc.) as well as Alt-Az mounts
(including Dobsonians, and the like.)

OnStep was designed, from the beginning, as a more or less general purpose
system and provisions were made in the firmware to allow for use on a variety
of mounts.

# Features
OnStep supports a wide variety of connection options.  Either two or three serial
"command channels" can be utilized. One of the these is normally devoted to a USB
connection and for the other(s) choose from the following:

* Bluetooth
* ESP8266 WiFi
* Arduino M0/Ethernet Shield
* Even another USB port or RS232 serial isn't very difficult to add.

Other software in the OnStep ecosystem include:

* an [ASCOM](http://ascom-standards.org/) driver (with IP and Serial support),
* an Android App useable over WiFi or Bluetooth equipped Phones/Tablets
  (version 2.3.3 or later),
* a "built-in" website (on the Ethernet and/or WiFi device),
* a full planetarium program that controls all features ([Sky Planetarium](http://stellarjourney.com/index.php?r=site/software_sky)).

OnStep is compatible with the LX200 protocol. This means it can be controlled
from other planetarium software, like: Sky Safari, CdC (even without ASCOM),
Stellarium, etc.

There are also [INDI](http://www.indilib.org/about.html) drivers so it can be used from Linux, with CdC or KStars.
